 * @brief The startup procedure for the MMB0 Server
 *
 *  This procedure initiates the DXP Next Generation program. 
 *  DxpMain.cpp performs the creation of the Mmb0Server which then creates 
 *  the devices and associated drivers. This program runs on top of the 
 *  DSP/BIOS and uses both the 55xx CSL and MMB0 libraries.
