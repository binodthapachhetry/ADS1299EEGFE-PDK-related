 *   interrupts (HWI and SWI) or task switches.
 * - finalizes the write to the data queue, making the
 *   data visible inside the "data" file. This is done by a
 *   call to \p adcq.finishWrite().
 *
 * \param[in] p Pointer to whatever is needed inside this
 * function. As this function will be called from an interrupt
 * service routine, it is of no real use.
