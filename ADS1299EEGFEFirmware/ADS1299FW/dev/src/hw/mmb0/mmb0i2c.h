/*! These functions provide access to the I2C system on the MMB0.  Functions for both multi-byte (i2c_wr(), i2c_rd()) and single-byte (i2c_w8(), i2c_r8()) transactions are provided.  There is also a read-modify-write function (i2c_frob()).

Before calling any of these functions, call i2c_init().

The MMB0's I2C bus is multiplexed into three separate busses.  Each data access function takes a parameter \p bus which identifies the bus on which to operate the transaction.  The following busses are available:

- I2C_BUS_DC -- the I2C pins on the daughtercard connector
- I2C_BUS_MB -- bus serving the MMB0's on-board I2C peripherals
- I2C_BUS_EXT -- the I2C expansion connector

For all I/O functions, I2C addresses must be in 8-bit format; the lower bit is ignored.  Note that some I2C documentation gives I2C addresses in 7-bit format.  Such addresses must be left-shifted once before use with these functions.

Each I/O function, with the exception of i2c_r8(), returns an error code indicating whether acknowledge bits were received as expected.  If 0, the transaction was acknowledged.

3. The result is written to \p bus and \p adr.
