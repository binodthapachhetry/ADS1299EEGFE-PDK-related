This port works with the USB peripheral on the Texas Instruments TMS320VC5509A and TMS320VC5507 DSPs, and is designed for use with DSP/BIOS.

This version has been built with DSP/BIOS 4.9.

This port does not use CSL.

\section usb_init() parameters

The struct c55x_params must be passed to usb_init().  It contains two fields: clkin_khz, which is used to set up the USB PLL, and us_per_prd_tick, which is used by the timeout mechanism.  See c55x_params for more information.

\section DSP/BIOS setup

This port may use MEM_alloc and MEM_free.  Segment 0 is used.

The DSP/BIOS configuration must include the following:

- HWI 8 must point to _usbhw_isr.

- A PRD object must be created to execute the function _usbhw_check_timeouts() (not a standard PORUS function).  The more often it runs, the more accurate timeouts will be, but the more processor time will be occupied.  50-100ms may be a good value to start with.

\section Implementation notes

This port is DMA driven and non-blocking.  It uses the undocumented ability of the USB peripheral to automatically produce chained packets on a single DMA transaction.  usb_evt_cpdone is therefore called only twice, since it need not participate in packet chaining.

\subsection Buffer count in buffer

The USB peripheral in the C5509 has a curious and unfortunate property.  When the DMA copies from the USB hardware to DSP memory, it inserts a word containing the actual transfer length at the beginning of the buffer.  The buffer is therefore two bytes (one word) longer than requested.

There is unfortunately no way to disable this "feature", save by copying the data manually from the USB peripheral, which, on the C5509, is a very inefficient operation.  Code which must run on the C5509 must therefore take this extra word into account when allocating buffers and processing data.

\subsection Timeouts

Timeouts are implemented using a watchdog function called by the PRD module, which the user must configure (see above).  This function checks for pending transactions on all endpoints which have timed out.  If it finds any, it cancels the transaction and sets the endpoint's timeout flag.

Timeout depends on the check_time field.  The watchdog function compares the current time to check_time, and if it is greater than the endpoint's timeout value, it times out the endpoint.

check_time is updated by the static function update_check_time(), which calls PRD_getticks.  check_time is therefore in units of ticks.  The watchdog function converts the timeout_ms field to ticks each time it is run (using ticks_to_ms()).

check_time is set at the following points:

- In the i/o functions
- At the DMA interrupt
- At IN and OUT interrupts
