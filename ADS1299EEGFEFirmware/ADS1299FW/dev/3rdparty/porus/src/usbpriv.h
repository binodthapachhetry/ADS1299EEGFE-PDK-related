- An endpoint has been enumerated and configured, and is ready for requests
- A transmission or reception request has completed, and the endpoint is ready for requests
- An endpoint cancellation has completed, and the endpoint is ready for requests
- An endpoint timeout has occurred, pending requests have been cancelled, and the endpoint is ready for requests
- An endpoint has been deconfigured, is now inactive, and is no longer ready for requests

This function may be called under interrupt.

The port must allow new requests to be submitted during this callback.
