//! Packet I/O request structure
/*! This structure encapsulates a request to transmit or receive a USB packet.  It identifies the endpoint, data length, and certain other parameters, and contains the actual data for the packet.  The structure is set up by the PORUS core and passed to usbhw_rx and usbhw_tx for processing.

Note that ports may implement a queueing scheme, where several requests can be active on a single endpoint at once.

When this structure is used for transmission (on an IN endpoint), the following fields are filled in:

 - \c data points to the data to be transmitted
 - \c reqlen is the number of bytes to be transmitted
 - \c ep identifies the endpoint to transmit on
 - \c done must be set to zero
 - \c timeout should be set as needed (not used yet)

Following transmission, the \c actlen field should contain the number of bytes that were actually transmitted, and \c done should be set to 1, indicating that the request was completed.  If \c actlen is zero, something went wrong; usually this means that a timeout occurred.

When this structure is used for reception (on an OUT endpoint), the following fields are filled in:

  - \c data points to an area in memory large enough to contain the received data
  - \c reqlen is the number of bytes requested
  - \c ep identifies the endpoint to receive from
  - \c done must be set to zero
  - \c timeout should be set as needed (not used yet)

Following reception, the \c actlen field should contain the number of bytes that were actually recieved, and \c done should be set to 1, indicating that the request was completed.  If \c actlen is zero, something went wrong; usually this means that a timeout occurred.

On blocking systems, this function copies the data in the request packet 
to a holding buffer, where it becomes ready for an IN.  This function 
does not wait for an IN; it returns when the copy is complete.

On nonblocking systems using DMA, this function sets up and activates the DMA transfer to the holding buffer, and returns immediately.  

On some systems, two or more requests can be active at once.  If no 
requests can be accepted, -1 is returned.

This function should never block waiting for a request slot to become available, even on blocking systems.  The core decides whether and how to wait for a free slot.

When a request is complete, the port must update the endpoint's \c actlen field by adding to it the number of bytes successfully transmitted; then usb_evt_cpdone() must be called.

\c pkt is the packet request structure.  When this function is called, the following fields in \c pkt are filled in:

  - \c data points to an area in memory large enough to contain the received data
  - \c reqlen is the number of bytes requested
  - \c ep identifies the endpoint to receive from
  - \c done is set to zero

Following reception, the \c actlen field should contain the number of bytes that were actually recieved, and \c done should be set to 1, indicating that the request was completed.  If something goes wrong, such as a timeout, \c actlen should be set to zero.

This function's return code indicates whether the request could be accepted; it does \e not indicate whether the request completed successfully, even on blocking systems.  For example, if a timeout occurs, this function should still return zero.
