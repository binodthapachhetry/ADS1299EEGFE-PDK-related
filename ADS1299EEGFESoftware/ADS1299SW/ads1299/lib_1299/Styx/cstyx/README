===========================
estyx: embedded Styx server version 0.1.0
===========================

estyx is a set of C functions which implement a server for the Styx / 9P2000 remote file protocol.  It is designed to serve synthetic device files, rather than to interface to an existing filesystem.

estyx is designed to be used in embedded systems, and is intended to be portable and operating system independent; it relies only on dynamic memory allocation, and does not require threads (although it is thread-safe).

estyx is also protocol agnostic.  The server communicates through functions and callbacks.  Any suitable transport may be connected to it.

Installation
------------

estyx is distributed as source code.  It is intended to be copied into a project.  As such there is no specific installation procedure; simply copy the files in src/ to your project.

estest
------

This distribution contains a library called "estest", which implements a demonstration estyx server on a PC.

estest is included in the cstyx library (cstyx.berlios.de) and is part of styxsh, which is distributed with cstyx.  See http://cstyx.berlios.de/ for more information.

Files
-----

The distribution contains the following:

doc/ - Documentation
src/ - Source code and header files
estest/ - A tester
README - This file
VERSION - Version number
LICENSE - Common Public License 1.0

Documentation
-------------

At present, estyx has little documentation.  The API is partly documented 
in Doxygen-formatted comments in the header files.

Contributions to the documentation (or any other part of estyx) are welcomed
and solicited.

About
-----

estyx began with code from libstyx, which is part of the Inferno operating system, 4th edition (www.vitanuova.com).  This code, which is distributed under a BSD-style license, was heavily modified in estyx, but some parts of libstyx remain more or less intact, in particular the marshalling-unmarshalling code.
