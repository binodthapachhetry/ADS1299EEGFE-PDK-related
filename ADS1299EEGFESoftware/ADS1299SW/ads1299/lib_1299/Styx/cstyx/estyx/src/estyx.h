//! Transmitter callback
/*! estyx uses this callback to transmit packets.  It should be handled by code capable of marshalling the packets onto a bus.

This callback uses two data pointers.  The first, \p msg, is always present and contains the Styx packet itself.  The other, \p data, is used only for Rread transactions.  It contains the data portion.

There are two length parameters, both given in bytes.  \p len is the length of \p msg.  \p len does not include the length of \p data.  \p datalen gives the length of \p data.

This is done for performance reasons.  Data is obtained from file callbacks, while the packet header is constructed by estyx.  The data must be concatenated to the packet header, which requires a potentially expensive copy operation.  Since this copy must be performed a second time in the USB hardware, we require the USB driver to perform the concatenation at that time.  Often, the copying can be combined at that time.

The \p data pointer is user-supplied, and is neither owned nor freed by estyx.  The \p msg pointer is owned by estyx.

Since estyx does not spawn threads, this call can only be made when an estyx call is made.  A user application may, however, use multiple threads, and this means that this call is not guaranteed to be made in a particular thread.

Currently, estyx will make this call in one of two situations:

- In response to a call to estyx_rx().  This is the most common situation.

- In response to a call from the filesystem layer.  This may happen for delayed replies or split read transactions.

Since the filesystem backend may operate a separate thread from the I/O frontend, the call may be placed from either the filesystem thread or the I/O thread, if these are separate.  This may give rise to a resource conflict.  If multiple threads are in use, estyx_tx() should contain a mutex locking system.

estyx_tx() may block while waiting for a mutex.  If this is the case, it should implement a timeout, to recover from possible deadlock.

	/*! Called when estyx reads from the file.  If this is null, estyx returns permission denied on reads.

	This function must call estyx_rread() with a buffer containing no more than \p len bytes.  Fewer bytes than this may be returned, but not more.  If it returns more bytes, the client may issue an error.

	To return EOF, call estyx_rread() with zero \p len or a null buffer pointer.

	estyx_rread() triggers the user-supplied transmit callback (see estyx_tx_cb).  Note that this may retain the buffer for a background transfer.  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that a buffer still in use is not overwritten or freed.

	estyx never calls estyx_rread() automatically.  It must be called from this function.  If it is not, no reply is issued, unless an error code is returned.

	\p pos is the position, in number of bytes from the beginning of the file, at which the read is requested to begin.  The read need not actually begin at \p pos.  For some files, such as streams, \p pos could be ignored.  However, \p pos may need to be checked to determine whether EOF should be returned.

	The function returns an error code.  Zero indicates success, -1 indicates an error, and -2 indicates that data is not yet available, but may be in future.

	\warning estyx may issue an error response if an error code is returned, even if estyx_rread() has been called.  Only return an error if no read response has been sent.

	\note Currently, estyx does nothing if -2 is returned.  Split transactions will be handled in a future release.

	\p mode is a byte describing the open mode.  Bits 0-1 are the requested access mode and can take one of four values:

	- 0 (OREAD) -- read access
	- 1 (OWRITE) -- write access
	- 2 (ORDWR) -- read and write access
	- 3 (OEXEC) -- execute access

	estyx checks the access mode against available file operations before calling open().  Read access is not permitted on a file with no read operation, and write access is not permitted on a file with no write operation.  Once the file has been opened, estyx will not permit read() to be called if the access mode is OWRITE, and it will not permit write() to be called if the access mode is OREAD.

	OEXEC is not used by estyx.

	Bit 4 (ORTRUNC), if set, requests that the file be truncated to zero on open, for OWRITE and ORDWR.  For OREAD, this bit will be zero.

	All other bits in \p mode should be ignored.

Execute permission is not affected (in estyx, files never have execute permission).  This function alters group, owner, and world permissions.

estyx checks permissions only when a file is opened.  This function therefore does not cause access to be disabled or enabled on files which are already open.  Subsequent opens will be affected.

This function does not operate on directories; in estyx, directories always have world read and execute permissions.  If \p f is a directory, this function does nothing.
